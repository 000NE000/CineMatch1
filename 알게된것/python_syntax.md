means that code block only runs if the file is the main entry point. If you later import that same file as a module, Python sets **name** to the module’s name instead, ensuring that the code block under this condition does not execute. This helps keep your script’s functionality cleanly separated between “library” code (which may be reused elsewhere) and “runner” code (which should only execute when the script is run directly).When Python runs a file directly, it sets the special variable **name** to "**main**". Placing your execution logic inside:
